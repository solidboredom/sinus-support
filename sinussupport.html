                <br>
                <li>step 1:create a 2D projection of your models .stl using openscad:

                    <br>open 2d-Projection-FromStl.scad in scad and followthe instructions inside to create a 2d Projection of your model and save it as SVG

                    <br>
                    <img src="images/2d-projection.png" width="400" height="200">

                <br>
                <li>
                    step 2: In the Webbrowser (sinussupport.html) in the controls at the TOP-LEFT enter the name of the SVG you have just created in openscad

                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    step 3: Click on Load SVG File and then on the "Get resulting Support Path scad code" which will appear if there were no errors

                <br>
                <li>step 4: save the resulting file under the suggested name "supportPathData.scad" in the same folder with the other files of this program.</li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    step 5: open sinusSupport.scad in openscad and render it. here comes your support Material.
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/supportMaterial.png" width="400" height="200">
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>step 6: edit the sinusSupport.scad or "include" it to UNION it with you original Model. (you could also subtract the hull of your Model from the support Material if you only need the support on bottom of the model, and not in its holes)
